#Design Process
For my design process, i first started out with making the header. I chose to make the header simple and easy to navigate so that customers will feel less overwhelmed. In some websites that i have visited, 
the navigation bars had too many things like dropdown menus and moving parts that it become very confusing to navigate.

I decided that i wanted to add a image slider to my home page. This provides the customers a first glimpse of the different promotions that are currently going on along with the different events.
It makes it easy for users to stay updated with the current events as they are the first thing their eyes are drawn to when they first enter the home page.

I did not want to clutter the home page too much so i decided to add some additional interesting animations and a bried description to the other pages below the image slider. I got this idea from Burger King, where on their home page they have a section that briefly describes who they are and some of their stories.
I feel that by doing this the website looks more inviting as users have a sneak peak of what they will be able to find out about the company. I also decided to add links to my other 2 pages.

For the animations, i had 2 options where the animation becomes a banner on top of the box that the users hover, 
or it becomes a button the users can click on to navigate to that page. In the end i decided to stick with the one that becomes a banner because i feel the one that transforms into a button leaves too much empty space.

For my menu page, i wanted to make a tab where users can choose between the breakfast and lunch menus. I got this idea from various websites. This allows users to be able to change to a different menu that has a very similar layout seemlessly.
I feel that this also seperates the menus as not every item is available at the same time. This way customers are able to see every item that is currently available to them.
