#Design Process

From my experience, websites with many different colors make it hard for the user to understand what it is that they are supposed to look at.

For my design process, i wanted to make a simplistic site that is easy to navigate around. I wanted  to make a site that users will be able to find out whatever information they needed easily. To do this, i chose to stick to a black and white color scheme.
This made it so that the content is able to stand out more which attracts the eyes of the user. 

I also found that a website jam packed with different items can be very hard to navigate, because of this, i have opted to do a very minimalistic design to make the contents of the page much clearer to the user.

#Features
For my design process, i first started out with making the header. I chose to make the header simple and easy to navigate so that customers will feel less overwhelmed. In some websites that i have visited, 
the navigation bars had too many things like dropdown menus and moving parts that it become very confusing to navigate.

Some of the websites that i went through had too much content in the home page. I was slightly confused at what was being displayed as they werent really sectioned out properly.
Because of this i decided to keep the home page simple.

I decided that i wanted to add a image slider to my home page. This provides the customers a first glimpse of the different promotions that are currently going on along with the different events.
It makes it easy for users to stay updated with the current events as they are the first thing their eyes are drawn to when they first enter the home page.

I did not want to clutter the home page too much so i decided to add some additional interesting animations and a bried description to the other pages below the image slider. I got this idea from Burger King, where on their home page they have a section that briefly describes who they are and some of their stories.
I feel that by doing this the website looks more inviting as users have a sneak peak of what they will be able to find out about the company. I also decided to add links to my other 2 pages.

For the animations, i had 2 options where the animation becomes a banner on top of the box that the users hover, 
or it becomes a button the users can click on to navigate to that page. In the end i decided to stick with the one that becomes a banner because i feel the one that transforms into a button leaves too much empty space.

For my menu page, i wanted to make a tab where users can choose between the breakfast and lunch menus. I got this idea from various websites. This allows users to be able to change to a different menu that has a very similar layout seemlessly.
I feel that this also seperates the menus as not every item is available at the same time. This way customers are able to see every item that is currently available to them.
When switching between lunch and dinner, the banner at the top of the page will also change depending if the user is on the breakfast or lunch menu.

I wanted to make my about page simple. I decided to add the image of the foudner as well as some background knowledge.
Afterward that i found a picture of a burger and add text beside it. This represents one of the commitments the company has to serve quality food.

I chose to add a social media section which allows the user to easily navigate to any social media the company has. this means they will be able to keep up to date with any events or promotions

The contact page beneath the social media acts as a feedback form for any user that would like to contact the company through their email and number

The promotions page allows the users to see what the current promotions are. For this page, i decided to make something similar to my index page. 
I chose to use a similar animation which now display items sideways instead of top to bottom.
This makes the website more interestintg an interactive as if the user is uncovering the different offers that the site has to offer.

#Technologies Used
I used javascript to be able to make the tab section in my menu page work.
I used javascript to make the image slider on the index page work.


#Testing
Contact form test:
1. Go to about us page
2. Fill in particulars
3. If email address is not properly filled in, user will not be able to submit and will be prompted to fill it in again

When making the animations for the boxes on the home page. I had quite a bit of trouble starting as i was not yet familiar with how the properties work.
I had to go through different websites like w3 schools to learn how the :hover feature in css works.
After some practice in a seperate file, i was able to get the box to animate the way i wanted.
I then used the boxes in my home page as well as a variation of it in my promotions page.

Originally when doing the index page, i had some trouble making my boxes responsive as the picture inside would get cut off halfway and the width was not acting the way i wanted it to.
I fixed this by changing the various width properties used when making the boxes.

Another problem i faced when using pictures is there were these lines at the bottom of the picture that i could not get rid off.
After some reasearching and trouble shooting, i fixed the problem by using the style "display: block" on the picture element. This finally got rid of the extra space at the bottom of my pictures.

For my menu page, i had some trouble aligning my food items properly during responsive. They would align unevenly and did not wrap the way i wanted it to go.
To combat this, instead of using flex-wrap, i used flex-direction: column instead to align them vertically. This made it much neater and it finally worked the way i had intended it to work in the first place.

I struggled making the about page as i could not find a decent design that was not too boring. I tried several different ideas, all of which were not very appealing to me.
After some research, i decided to take insipiration from Itacho Sushi's about page.
The sushi page used an medium sized image with a few small paragraphs of text on the left.
I thought that the look it provided was simple yet appealing.
I implemented this idea along with my other content in my about us page such as the background information, social media links and contact us form.

I decided that i wantd to use what i learned recently about hover in another of my pages.
In a seperate file, i started to experiment with different on hover effects.
My goal was to have the effect reveal additional information of the promotion when the user hovers over it.
After much testing, i came up with the idea of having the user hover over the picture of the promotion.
Then the picture would darken and a paragraph of text would appear on the right side explaining what the promotion is about.

I had trouble making the promotions page responsive. I played around with it and ended up changing the width sizes of the box during different pixel width of the device. I also changed the placing of some of the text
on mobile devices. To accomodate that i also had to add font weight to the text to make sure it is visible.

This website is responsive and mobile devices will be able to surf this page as well. The mobile view for the website will have different layouts. Most of which will be aligned vertically instead of horizontally
as the mobile screen is much smaller than on a computer. This allows the mobile user to still be able to find all the information they need using their mobile phones.
